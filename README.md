There are three event handlers numbered 1,2,3, and I have added the @Order Annotation to each, to attempt to run them in reverse order.  Currently it runs them in classname alpha order due to class path loading, but this should not be how I need to control event handler execution order.  The unit test attached will fail, as it its expecting the data to be set on the entity via the eventHandlers, which will only happen if they are run in reverse order.
